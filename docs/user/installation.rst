Installation
============

Bottom supports **Python 3.12+** and has no external dependencies.

Standard Installation
---------------------

The easiest way is with pip::

    pip install bottom


Alternative Installation
------------------------

Sometimes the code on GitHub is ahead of the latest PyPI release.  There are two ways to install from GitHub.  First,
by cloning the repo::

    git clone git://github.com/numberoverzero/bottom.git
    pip install ./bottom

Since pip supports installing from a git repo, you can also use::

    pip install -e git://github.com/numberoverzero/bottom.git#egg=bottom
